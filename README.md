# Lightswitch

This is my assignment for **Module 6 - React State Management**

## Live Site

- [Live Site](https://lightswitch-one.vercel.app/)

## About

- I reproduced a Lightswitch from this [tutorial](https://medium.com/lets-make-something-up/creating-light-dark-mode-on-a-react-app-with-context-589a5465f639) using **React** with **Context**

- _"To use Context, you basically have to call createContext() to create the wanted context, and then set a context provider function to make it accessible to other components. To understand it further, check the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#reactcreatecontext)."_

## Running the site
